This is the README file. We are going to put important information about the game in this file. **[Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ioeeD3LapDI)**

## Introduction
2 player card turn-based game based on musical gameplay. The user will have a basic profile e.g., cast/class, health, stamina, and shield. The player gets a set number of cards (8). They can use special attacks and the entire board can get affected. Cards can have offensive, defensive or gaining health/stamina. Each player can cast a spell or attack on others.
  - Attack: Health damage
  - Defensive (Shield generate)
We will also add multiplayer to allow players on the same network to play together. It will be turn-based so that the game revolves from player to player.
